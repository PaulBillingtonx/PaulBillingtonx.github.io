<p>All persons with alarm systems securing a property in the City of Fredericksburg should have a legitimate alarm permit. A growing number of people use smart home gadgets to control things from another location, like the thermostat or lights. Voice activation platforms like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant prevail as well. There are self-monitored systems that use home automation combinations, much of which work with clever locks too. Most of the companies specify their automation choices on the web page.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it quickly. False alarms occur.
