<p>In addition they can not transmit fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are continuously helping customers replace. As professionals in the industry our advice is to keep away. If you do buy them, first check the suppliers return policy and 2nd keep the receipt.</p>
