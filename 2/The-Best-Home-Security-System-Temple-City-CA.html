<p>Wireless cameras can be an excellent option for a video surveillance system.

<p>One essential exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be a budget friendly choice for consumers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems because they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't available. If you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still far better than no security at all.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>ADT, Frontpoint, and Vivint all offer pet-friendly motion detectors when it comes to indoor security equipment. Their detectors utilize infrared innovation, so its harder for a pet dog or feline to trip the sensing unit. Vivint's sensing units are unsusceptible to pets weighing as much as 33 to 55 pounds. Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to animals weighing as much as 40 pounds. With ADT, the expert installer can tailor the level of sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size. </p>
