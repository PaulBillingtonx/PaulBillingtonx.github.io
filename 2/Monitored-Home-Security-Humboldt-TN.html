<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and configuration information to make this integration work, there are just 2 choices. The very first alternative, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or unwilling to provide those information) and record the geography and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and change, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and might even activate incorrect alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
