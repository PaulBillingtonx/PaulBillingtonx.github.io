<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your general security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
