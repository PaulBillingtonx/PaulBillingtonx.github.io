All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide.
