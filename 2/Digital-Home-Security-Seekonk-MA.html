<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
