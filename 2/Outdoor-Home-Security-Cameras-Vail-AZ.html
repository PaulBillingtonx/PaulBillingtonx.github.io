<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 each month, which might be a budget friendly alternative for consumers in rural areas. We suggest cellular systems due to the fact that they're much more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
