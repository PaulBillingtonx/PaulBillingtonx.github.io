<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensors to neglect items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
