<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom.

<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is vital.

Being able to distinguish between a vehicle and an individual, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, particularly if you're looking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
