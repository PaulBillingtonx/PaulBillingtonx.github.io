<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge.
