<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
