<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature.

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
