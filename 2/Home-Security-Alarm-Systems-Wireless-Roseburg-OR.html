<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
