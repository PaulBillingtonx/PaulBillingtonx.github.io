<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
