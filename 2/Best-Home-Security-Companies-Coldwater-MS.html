<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>

However ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer support experience varies commonly depending upon the dealer you opt for. </p>
