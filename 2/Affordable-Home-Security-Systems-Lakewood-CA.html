<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular because the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies simply to let the person being seen know they're being viewed, and you can pick to tape-record video or photos and conserve them to your clever device on a whim. </p>
