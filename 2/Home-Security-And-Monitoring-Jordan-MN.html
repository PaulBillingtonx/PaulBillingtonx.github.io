<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
