<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is needed. There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built documents providing performance and setup details to make this integration work.

The other method is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
