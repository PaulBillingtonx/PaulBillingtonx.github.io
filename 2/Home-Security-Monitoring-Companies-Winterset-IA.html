<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Our experience with professional installation was mixed. Our tester stated the specialist offered strong client service: He dropped a couple of unneeded window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the entire front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with connecting the command center to our tester's network. </p>
