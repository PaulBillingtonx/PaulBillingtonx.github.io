<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current suggestion.</p>

This seriously limits your options for syncing a SimpliSafe system with third-party clever home gadgets like lights, locks, outlets, and thermostats.

<p>In the end, for most consumers, making the best choice will come down to the company's client service track record and your particular equipment needs.
