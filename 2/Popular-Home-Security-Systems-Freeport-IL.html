<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more budget-friendly memberships out there at $2.99 a month.

We likewise found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
