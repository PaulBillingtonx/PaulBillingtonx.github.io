<p>Now I mentioned this looked like a stretch thinking about previous Sims video games had intruders, however my good friend mentioned the Sims 4 was made for a new generation, with a team of manufacturers surrounded by people OF that generation who would point out that the intrusion of their home or safe place might develop feelings of discomfort or possible even triggering.
