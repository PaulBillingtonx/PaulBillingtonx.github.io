<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.

When possible, we evaluated each camera using an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) along with an Android smart device (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
