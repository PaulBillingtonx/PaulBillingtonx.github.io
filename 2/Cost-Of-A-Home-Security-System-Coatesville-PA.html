We also experienced above-average connection concerns, with two Hive test systems disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>

Which's what Nest provides you.</p>
<p>In fact, government action was just recently taken against Vivint due to the fact that the company had problems with alleged misstatement of provided services and working with unlicensed company agents.
