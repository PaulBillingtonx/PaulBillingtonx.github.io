<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get totally featured, professional-grade security solutions that are easy to install and easy to use. Wireless Security Systems utilize local hard drive, cloud storage, or a mix of the two in location of videotape video used by landline systems. Ring video security cameras are high definition, but they are set to tape only when motion is discovered.
