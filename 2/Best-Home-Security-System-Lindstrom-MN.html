For starters, Deep Learning permits somebody to find what they are searching for without needing to search through hours of useless video footage.  Picture a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the aspects you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a patrol car in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a police cruiser appears.
