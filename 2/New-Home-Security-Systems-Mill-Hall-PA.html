<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
