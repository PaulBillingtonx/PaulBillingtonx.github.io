You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your home and ownerships.

<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hr a day. Offering customers the option of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other devices a la carte, makes good sense for a number of reasons.

Appears like a much safer bet to us.</p>
