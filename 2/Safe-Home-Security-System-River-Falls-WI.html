<p>Lastly, I have a look at a home security system's app, ensuring it's technologically sound and user-friendly, particularly if there is home automation included.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
