<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long variety circumstances where trees and poles are not present.</p>

<p>A number of other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

<p>The possible value of public surveillance innovation was well demonstrated all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators recognized the two suspects in the Boston Marathon battle after sorting through video images recorded by the city's cameras.
