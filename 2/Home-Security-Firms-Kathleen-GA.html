So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I remained in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Really annoying. Again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that obviously they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
