We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
