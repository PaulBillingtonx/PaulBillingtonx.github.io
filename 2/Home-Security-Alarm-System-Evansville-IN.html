<p>Nevermind how great the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to third party companies?

<p>Put simply, security doorbells are simply small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame.

The videos your camera records most likely won't be minimized the camera itself. The majority of home security cameras use cloud services to save and use remote access to footage Some designs have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you wish to evaluate video, however this is a rare feature.</p>
