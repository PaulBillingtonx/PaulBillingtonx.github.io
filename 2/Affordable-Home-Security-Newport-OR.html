The camera features an outdoor-rated 25-foot adapter and power cable. It's prolonged, and that's a good thing if your preferred mounting place isn't near an outlet.

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. There are only 2 choices if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and configuration details to make this integration work. The first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unwilling or unavailable to offer those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.

Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power. </p>
