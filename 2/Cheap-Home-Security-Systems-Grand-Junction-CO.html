<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually detected trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens might break local sound control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
