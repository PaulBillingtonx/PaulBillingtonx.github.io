<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be a cost effective choice for customers in backwoods. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
