<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
