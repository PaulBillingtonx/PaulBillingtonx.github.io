<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
