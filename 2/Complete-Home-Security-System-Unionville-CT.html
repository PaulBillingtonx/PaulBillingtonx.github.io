It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>In short, the expansion of surveillance cameras has rapidly minimized our ability to keep privacy in public spaces; and the arrival of automated face acknowledgment and other tracking technologies only accelerate this hazard to privacy.
