We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
