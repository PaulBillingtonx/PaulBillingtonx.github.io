We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION).
