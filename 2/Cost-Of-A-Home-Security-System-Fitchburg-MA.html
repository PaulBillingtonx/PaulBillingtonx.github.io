Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower price if you go with a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better deal for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least 3 years.

Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and for that reason is still the better choice for lots of who are just concerned about cost. </p>
