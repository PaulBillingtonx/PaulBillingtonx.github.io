That isn't to say that you can't have actually wired home automation, since you can, but automated equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and more difficult to encrypt.

Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
