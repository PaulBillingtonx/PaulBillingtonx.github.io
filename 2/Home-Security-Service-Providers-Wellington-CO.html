<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
