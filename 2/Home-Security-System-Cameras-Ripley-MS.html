<p>After testing, we sent out each of our top choices, in addition to the Wyze Webcam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of information security at The New york city Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack screening.

<h3>Electronic Security Systems in Ripley MS</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

Some systems provide both cloud storage and local storage, and some offer a dedicated storage drive that offers you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, which makes it simple to discover a video event that happened at a particular time.</p>
