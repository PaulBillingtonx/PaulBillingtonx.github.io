<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. You get 1080p HD streaming, a 130-degree field of vision, the usual movement signals, and a 90+ dB alarm that is likely to frighten any approaching burglar before they've got too far into your home. When you're at home and don't desire to be tape-recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security systems use a passcode, the Brinks Home Security app, Bluetooth hands-free disarming and an optional keychain remote. Some break-ins and attacks occur at night. But the huge bulk take place during the day when no one is home. Some burglars break glass to reach in and unlock doors and windows. But the smarter ones do not since they do not want to leave blood DNA at the scene. They 'd rather start your door or pry open a window.</p>
