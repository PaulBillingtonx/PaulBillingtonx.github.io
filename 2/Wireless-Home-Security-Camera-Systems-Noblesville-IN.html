<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensors. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This means that you have to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your residential or commercial property is bigger than 4,500 square feet.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
