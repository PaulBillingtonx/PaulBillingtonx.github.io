<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and frequently over fars away.

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, generally through 110VAC power. </p>
