The Arlo Ultra doesn't included a totally free tier of cloud storage, so you have to invest at least $3 each month if you want to save any videos. And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the first year. But if you want the outright best when it concerns video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
<p>For a one-time fee of $39.95, the company uses an individual customer-support service called Ring Assist Plus, that includes a VIP assistance line, 3-year service warranty (rather than the basic one year), and life time purchase protection, among other functions.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
