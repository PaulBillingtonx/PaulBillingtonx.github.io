<p>Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

<h3>House Alarm Companies in Durham NC</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
