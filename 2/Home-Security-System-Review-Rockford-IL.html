<p>Do burglar alarms represent burglary decreases in the United States? The U.S. burglary rate has declined gradually and substantially since the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the very same time, the variety of properties with alarms rose, but there is no proof of a link between the two. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a steep rise, other kinds of criminal activity declined simply as sharply as theft, recommending that aspects other than an increase in the number of alarm sustained the burglary decrease.</p>
