<p>These cameras can catching and transmitting really sensitive information," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key recorded during the network recovery.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is bad.
