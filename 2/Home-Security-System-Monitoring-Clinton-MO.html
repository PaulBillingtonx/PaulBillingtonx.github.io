Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens.
