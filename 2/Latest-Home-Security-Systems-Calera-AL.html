<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and possessions. In case your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are standing by to react by immediately contacting you and if requirement be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Cameras typically broadcast footage over the Internet, allowing operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
