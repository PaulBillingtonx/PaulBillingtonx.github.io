<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to leave the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no idea I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide.
