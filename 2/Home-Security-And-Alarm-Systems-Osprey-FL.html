<p>Recently, Ring denied reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure.

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
