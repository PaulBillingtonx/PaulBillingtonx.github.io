Some DVRs also allow digital broadcasting of the video signal, therefore acting like a network camera. If a gadget does enable broadcasting of the video, but does not tape-record it, then it's called a video server These gadgets successfully turn any analogue camera (or any analogue video signal) into a network TV.</p>
<p>The density of access points can even be a problem - there are a minimal variety of channels offered, and they partially overlap.

CCTV cameras are just a less effective alternative to having authorities walk the streets or security workers on patrolling and physical surveillance. As with any technology, the use of cameras is by no means a substitute for good old-fashioned ground work. The camera video footage provides additional leads in an examination and aids in securing witness cooperation. The video footage acts as a complement to - but not a replacement for - eyewitness evidence in the courtroom.</p>
