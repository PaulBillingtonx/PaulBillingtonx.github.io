Modern systems now have sensational abilities", though these have produced reasonable misgivings about the danger for personal privacy and possible abuse such abilities create. Porter therefore kept in mind that the Office and surveillance industry should make sure only software and hardware certified with pertinent requirements, such as Secure by Default, is set up in personal and public spaces alike.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often coupled with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the facilities control unit contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as getting in touch with property owners, notifying cops, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals may be transmitted via devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>

The sound may frighten off prospective burglars-- if you're lucky if your system equipment consists of an audible alarm. However the authorities will not come until you personally call them. </p>
