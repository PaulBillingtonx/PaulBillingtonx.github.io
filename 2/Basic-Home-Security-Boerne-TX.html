<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect complacency because it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
