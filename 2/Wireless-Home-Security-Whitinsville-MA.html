<h3>Home Protection Alarm System in Whitinsville MA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
