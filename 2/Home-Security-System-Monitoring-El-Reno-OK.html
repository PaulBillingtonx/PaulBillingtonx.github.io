<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's facility can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>

<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to efficiency concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (up to 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, frequently buffered, and had a reset function that left gaps of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
<p>According to IndustryARC insights, the night vision devices market has been proliferating in the last few years - driven by increased public need and surveillance activities. Night vision is an important feature of video surveillance, especially for outdoor security. It permits technicians to recognize and hinder criminal offense at night when your business is most susceptible to burglaries, robberies, and vandalism - making it a financial investment that need to not be ignored.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick response times and total flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was quite darn and simple and easy smooth. Otherwise, this company uses a comparable feature-set as brands like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is offered today, it's safe to state that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Given all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why a lot of people are picking this option. </p>
