The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
