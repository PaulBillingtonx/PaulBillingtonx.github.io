It won't work with loads of wise home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely impressive, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensor in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2.

We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>
