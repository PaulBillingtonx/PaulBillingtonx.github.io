<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning clever alarm, this system was practically as easy to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren fasted to sound if one of the sensing units had actually been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just informs you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get signals on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and additional sensing units, too.</p>
