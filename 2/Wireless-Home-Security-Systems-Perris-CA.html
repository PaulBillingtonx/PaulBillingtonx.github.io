<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<h3>Alarm Monitoring System Perris CA 92570</h3>
<p>So far so normal. Things begin to get really intriguing with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system. If the camera finds an admit it does not recognise, it will send a notification and picture to your phone, allowing you to give that individual the once over.

<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which immediately focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape-record; whatever within their focus capability is captured. That is to state, CCTV cameras are pretty un-focused when it comes to separating the images of an active event about to take place. But you can't buy this camera on its own-- you need to add to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
