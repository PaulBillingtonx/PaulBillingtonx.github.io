<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and ownerships. On the occasion that your alarm is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to respond by instantly contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Because this post was initially put together in 2014, the capabilities of video surveillance systems have been transformed by essential shifts in how digital data is gathered, evaluated, shared and kept. Security cameras are already playing a key role in the drive to smarter cities and the burgeoning commercial internet of things. Deep knowing and AI is becoming more widespread, as cameras have the ability to more accurately collect information and make predictions based on integrated analytical software producers have developed.</p>

<p>London has more than 10,000 CCTV cameras whirring away 24 hr a day. Offering consumers the alternative of a more full-service security offering, beyond offering alarms and other devices a la carte, makes sense for a couple of reasons.

You can extend the amount of days you get by purchasing a subscription, but I do not think most people will need that alternative.</p>
<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I enjoy the Hive View's design - certainly the most visually pleasing camera on this list.
