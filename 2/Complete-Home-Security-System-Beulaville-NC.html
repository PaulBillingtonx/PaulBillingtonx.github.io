<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had issues. The switch from daylight to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked fine switching from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was performing the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes before it even observed I existed. </p>
