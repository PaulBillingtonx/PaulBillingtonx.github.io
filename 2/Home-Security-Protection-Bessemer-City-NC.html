<p>One of the first choices that you'll need to make is if you require a wireless or wired security camera system, and the proper answer most likely depends on where you plan to position the parts and cameras.

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the required systems is needed. There are just 2 choices if there are no as-built documents offering performance and setup info to make this integration work. The first alternative, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or unavailable to offer those details) and record the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to replace and rip, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
<p>The possible value of public surveillance technology was well shown all the way back in April, 2013 when investigators identified the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras.
