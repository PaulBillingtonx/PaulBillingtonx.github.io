We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and just notifies you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect informs). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have essential fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
