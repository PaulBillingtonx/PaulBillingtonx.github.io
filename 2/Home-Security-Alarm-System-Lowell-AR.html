<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>Since the glass housing doesn't obstruct, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being fantastic for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for infrared and low-light given that the glass real estate doesn't hinder the lens. With some, it's difficult to tell at a glance where they've been aimed, so they can offer a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their true field of vision. Installing a video surveillance system with a few of these is an excellent alternative for a number of various configurations.</p>
