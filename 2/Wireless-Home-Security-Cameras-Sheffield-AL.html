<p>The Blue by ADT Outdoor Camera is an operate in progress. We've seen enhancements throughout our short time with the battery-operated camera, however we just can't suggest a $200 camera that doesn't offer the ability to zoom video and will not have the ability to hold up against outdoor temperature levels listed below 14 degrees Fahrenheit.
