<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

<p>Regardless of having an operating temperature of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be harder to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it given that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt performance.</p>
