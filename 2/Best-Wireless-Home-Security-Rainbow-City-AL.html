<p>Whether you decide to opt for a DIY system or select a professionally installed system, you'll need to pay a yearly or monthly cost if you need monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a regular monthly charge to settle the cost of hardware components. With most Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Set, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you buy the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly charges if you choose to self-monitor. If you add monitoring, fees will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 per month. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you commit to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus strategy goes for $10 each month and does not require an agreement.</p>
