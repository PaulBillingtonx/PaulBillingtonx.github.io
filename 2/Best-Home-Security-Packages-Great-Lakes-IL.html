<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>What actually sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey however is necessary. In fact, we don't advise purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an automobile and a person, for example, permits you to reduce unneeded notifies.
