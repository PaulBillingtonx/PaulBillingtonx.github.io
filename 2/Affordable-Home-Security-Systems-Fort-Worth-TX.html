<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've ditched my Nest Cams considering that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will suffice. Keep in mind that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so examine ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
