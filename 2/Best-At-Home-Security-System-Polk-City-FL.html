<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen.
