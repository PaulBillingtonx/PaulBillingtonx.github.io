<h2>Security Systems For Home And Business Midland</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet economical systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and watch it later.

<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that steep, even at $499, due to the fact that it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That person at Deep Guard's center can alert a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act.
