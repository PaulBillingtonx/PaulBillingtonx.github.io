<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation items at an affordable cost, the one location where the company particularly excels remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
