<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are slightly more pricey for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation costs are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
