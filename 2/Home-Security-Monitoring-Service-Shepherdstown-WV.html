<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files supplying functionality and setup details to make this combination work, there are just 2 choices. The first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is reluctant or not available to supply those information) and record the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>
