<h2>Home Monitoring & Automation Satellite Beach</h2>
<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really idea of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long method, spanning a number of decades. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems offered today. The very first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape video and enjoy it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>There are two outdoor security camera designs - dome or bullet-shaped.

<p>Professional installation was almost the only method to put in a home security system 15 years ago.
