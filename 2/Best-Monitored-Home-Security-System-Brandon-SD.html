<p>We searched for Do It Yourself systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer totally free or greatly reduced hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals might wish to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

We've seen it highlight cars and trucks, moths, and mice.</p>
