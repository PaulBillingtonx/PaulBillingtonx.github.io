<p>According to a report, homes that don't have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and operates its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which simultaneously messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm.

<p>A system that needs a contract may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?
