<p>That depends on your budget and convenience with threat. Initially glance, a $40 or $50 each month monitoring charge can seem high, however that adds up to $600 or less annually. Keep in mind that the more features and bonus you add to your system, the larger the price tag. Some top-tier packages cost upward of $60 monthly. That's still substantial, however it's a lot less than the average loss of a break-in.

<p>Primarily, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, however it's much better than a great deal of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of night, usage and day images have actually always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we experienced when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a creative feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
