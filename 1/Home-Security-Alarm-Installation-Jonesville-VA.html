<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be pricey but is essential. In fact, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to distinguish between an automobile and a person, for example, allows you to cut down on unneeded alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, and even trash bin. </p>
