<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Old Town FL 32680</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
