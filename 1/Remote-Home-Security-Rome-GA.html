As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical because the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
