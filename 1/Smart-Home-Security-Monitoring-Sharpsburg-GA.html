<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is vital.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to distinguish between a car and a person, for example, permits you to reduce unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, an entrance, and even trash bin. </p>
