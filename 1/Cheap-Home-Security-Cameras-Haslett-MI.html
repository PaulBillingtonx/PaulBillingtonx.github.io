<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
