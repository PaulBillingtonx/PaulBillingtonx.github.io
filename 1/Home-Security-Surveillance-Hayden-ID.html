Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
