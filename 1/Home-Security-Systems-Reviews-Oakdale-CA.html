<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
