Outdoor cameras ought to be weather evidence, vandal evidence, and come equipped with night vision. Other features may consist of an integrated motion detector. It's important to buy equipment that can stand up to your local climate condition, be that extreme heat, cold, or wetness. Cameras are likewise exposed to anyone who approaches your home, so you need to think about how your video feed is safeguarded from vandals smashing the camera. Vandal-proof cameras safeguard the camera lens from damage with a polycarbonate dome cover or metal real estate.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only a false complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
