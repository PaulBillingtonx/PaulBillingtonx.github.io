<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who happens to be my husband).

We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
