<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a really typical type of 2 piece sensor that runs with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either generally open or generally closed when under the impact of a magnetic field as when it comes to distance to the 2nd piece which includes a magnet.

This action combined with an electric current (usually at 12V DC) enables an alarm control panel to identify a fault on that zone or circuit.
