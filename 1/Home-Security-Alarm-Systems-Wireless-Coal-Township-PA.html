<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically much safer, but after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel essentially vulnerable. The other noteworthy things about the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo model which I'm going to go over in simply a 2nd), it is developed for outdoor as well as indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine. It also has a USB slot so you can record your video footage straight onto there, which conserves you needing to deal with the cloud storage system described above.</p>

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
