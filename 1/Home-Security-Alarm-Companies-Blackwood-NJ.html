<p>Primarily, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are four times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of use, day and night images have constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when evaluating the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a creative function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight vehicles, mice, and moths.</p>
