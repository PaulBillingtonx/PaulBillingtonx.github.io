We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect alerts). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have crucial fobs and extra sensing units, too.</p>
