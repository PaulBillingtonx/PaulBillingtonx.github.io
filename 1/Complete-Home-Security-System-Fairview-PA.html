The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurers bring into question the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent false alarms.</p>

Panic alarms receive authorities response based upon worry of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms typically get fire response based on an emergency situation due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.</p>
