<h3>Security Camera System For Home Mechanicville NY 12118</h3>

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera individually, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
