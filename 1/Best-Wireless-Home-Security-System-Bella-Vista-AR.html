<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users ought to reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure.

If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these problems modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
