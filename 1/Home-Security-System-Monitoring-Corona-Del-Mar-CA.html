<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over long distances.

This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls however will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
