<p>There are numerous factors that determine how much a burglar alarm system costs. Equipment, installation, monthly monitoring, extra protection, service calls, and tech assistance, all identify your last cost.

If you add monitoring, charges will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 monthly. The cost of the Nest service drops to $19 per month if you dedicate to a three-year contract. Ring's Protect Plus strategy chooses $10 each month and doesn't need a contract.</p>
