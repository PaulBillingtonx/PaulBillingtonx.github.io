<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to spot any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
