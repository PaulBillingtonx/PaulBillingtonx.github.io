<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
