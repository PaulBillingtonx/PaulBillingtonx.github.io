<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter package". So it's pretty much anticipated that it will not have actually extended customizability or a wide variety of functions.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little bit of an issue is in between recording and spotting movement. Since the Pro 2 doesn't do constant video recording, it takes a 2nd for the camera to actually turn on when it spots motion.

I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
