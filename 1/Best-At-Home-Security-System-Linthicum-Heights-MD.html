<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
