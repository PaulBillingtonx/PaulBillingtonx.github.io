With among these, your taped video is sent out to a remote server and kept for a predetermined time-- normally anywhere from 24 hours to a week-- and then erased to make space for new videos.

Spending for the equipment up front provides you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as lot of times as you want.</p>
