<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems normally cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, come with long and normally burdensome contracts, and often depend on the exact same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they provide little advantage.

Now, a lot of security systems include a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, glass, and motion break sensors, a keypad, and essential fobs, to name a few components.

Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensor, window sensing unit, clever lock, etc.), I wish to make sure that they all easily interact with your app that is always at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
