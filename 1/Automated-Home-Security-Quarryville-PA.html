<p>Yes, house owners can select to self-monitor" their home security system.

The first thing that somebody who is buying a home security system ought to do is understand their home. Different types of homes gain from particular kinds of security systems and monitoring.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
