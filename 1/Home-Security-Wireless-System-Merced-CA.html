Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not point out the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to check out the small print.

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, however it's not a lot when you think about that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's facility can caution a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local authorities dispatcher if they decline to engage or leave in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
