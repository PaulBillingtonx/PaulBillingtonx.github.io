Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>From the app or push-button control, a door might be locked or an alarm could be set, for example. The system includes a main base system and 6 monitoring stations that send alert signals to authorities, a keypad, entry sensors, and motion detectors for the most extensive protection available.
