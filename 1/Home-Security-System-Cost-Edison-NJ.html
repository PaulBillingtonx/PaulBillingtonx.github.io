Worth keeping in mind: you can also get an outdoor variation (₤ 199.99, Amazon) which is essentially the same but with a range included functions. This one has a motion-sensor and switches on a light and siren which might be a good deterrent to burglars, plus it's obviously water resistant and has a longer cable.

<p>When choosing a home security camera is whether you need an outdoor or indoor camera, the other major choice. Outdoor cameras will frequently be constructed to be more resilient and able to make it through rain, frost, or damp.

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>

The camera consists of features like totally free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, however it doesn't take snapshots of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions found on many surveillance cameras. </p>
