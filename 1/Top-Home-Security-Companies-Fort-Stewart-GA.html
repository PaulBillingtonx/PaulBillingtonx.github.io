<p>Today everything moves rapidly, and innovation has actually contributed to life's complexity the magic of fax machines, computer systems, tablets, and smart phones, all efficient in providing multimedia through numerous channels to a mass of receivers, without having to integrate with anyone. When it happens, the message is received and the reaction happens.
