<h3>Home Protection Systems Eastman GA 31023</h3>
<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, beginning with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its double articulating LED floodlights cover an extremely wide area, and you can dim them through its app if you desire mood lighting on your deck or outdoor patio for a celebration. Video surveillance systems are more crucial than ever in today's business environment. All businesses - big or small - need an effective system to secure their properties and remain rewarding.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send out smart device signals with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
