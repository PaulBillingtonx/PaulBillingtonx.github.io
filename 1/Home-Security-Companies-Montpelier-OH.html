<h3>CCTV Camera System in Montpelier OH</h3>

<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
