Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>In spite of the truth that practically all significant home security companies include fantastic styles, SimpliSafe equipment is quite stylish and unique in its look.

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>

Typically, in this instance, a security company will often give you the equipment free of charge and offer you with a free installation.
