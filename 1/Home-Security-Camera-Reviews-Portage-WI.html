<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, typically utilize battery-powered transmitters which are much easier to install and have less costly start-up costs, but might fail if the batteries are not kept. Depending upon distance and construction materials, several wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel dependably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home easily, an advantage for those who lease or who move frequently. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station.

<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms vary from panic alarms, which are covered.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
