Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's a debate that's typically skewed by elements such as skepticism over the vulnerability of wireless systems, consisting of interference from radio signals and problems that cause incorrect alarms. While enhancements recently have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own special wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), concerns persist over vulnerabilities that don't impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Normally, the most intense frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
