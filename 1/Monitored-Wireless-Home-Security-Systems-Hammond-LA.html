With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without difficulty. The IR lights during the night have the ability to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out signals, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
