For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>

When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they appear at your home.

We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
