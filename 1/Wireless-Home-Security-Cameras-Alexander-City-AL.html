<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales consultant. He provided the suggestions regarding what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek got here and dealt with the installation right on time. He consulted with us concerning placement of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in loading the app and finishing the online set-up procedure. He also reviewed the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were really professional and helpful. Thanks.</p>
