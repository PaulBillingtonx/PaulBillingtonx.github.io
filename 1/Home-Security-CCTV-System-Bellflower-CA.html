Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's typically manipulated by factors such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While improvements recently have made the technology more robust and popular (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be interfered with by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
