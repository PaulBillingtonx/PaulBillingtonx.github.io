<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
