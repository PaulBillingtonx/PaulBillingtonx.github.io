The privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera when you're at home and don't want to be recorded.</p>

For bigger homes, expect closer to $1,000, especially if you require the system to be expertly set up.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it spots an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to function as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
