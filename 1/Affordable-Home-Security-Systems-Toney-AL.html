<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety".

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
