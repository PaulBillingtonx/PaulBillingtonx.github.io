Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
