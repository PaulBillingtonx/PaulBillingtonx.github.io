If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not think that these issues change the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing suggestion.</p>
