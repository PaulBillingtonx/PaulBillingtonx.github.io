<p>One of the top home security providers given that entering the business in 1992, Protect America offers service for numerous countless consumers around the United States and Canada. They provide flexibility in their equipment and readily available plans, allowing house owners to pick the security service that best fits their needs. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to Secure America suggested by their low C- ranking from BBB.

This, combined with the serious penalty for early cancellation-100% of the remaining balance plus paying for all of the equipment-may offer some time out in choosing Protect America as their home security service.</p>
