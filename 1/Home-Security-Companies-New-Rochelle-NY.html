If there are no as-built files supplying functionality and setup info to make this combination work, there are only 2 choices. The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial option provider is unwilling or not available to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system.
