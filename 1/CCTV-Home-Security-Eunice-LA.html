<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
