<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable and non-weatherproof plug. (You can protect that plug and include another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension package, or purchase a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per system than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof solution. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it since its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>

The company depends on long-term agreements (although they do use discounts in addition to some long-lasting contracts), uses no expert installation choice, no landline alternative, and has the greatest regular monthly monitoring fees of all the companies we reviewed.</p>
