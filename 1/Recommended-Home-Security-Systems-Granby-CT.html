<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are a little more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>Select particular features that match your circumstance. For example, if you experience regular power outages, a security system that uses battery back-up would be a practical option. Lifestyle patterns are also an aspect. If your family takes a trip regularly, you will need a monitoring service to deal with any signals that might take place while you re away.</p>
