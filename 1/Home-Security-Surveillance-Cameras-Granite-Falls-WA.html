Some systems save recorded video locally on an SD card or a strong state drive, while others offer cloud storage. In your area saved video is a good choice for do-it-yourselfers on a budget plan, but you need to beware not to overwrite video you may need later. Cloud storage makes it easy to store and gain access to recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars each year depending upon your membership.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
