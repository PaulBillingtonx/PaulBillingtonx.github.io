When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>
