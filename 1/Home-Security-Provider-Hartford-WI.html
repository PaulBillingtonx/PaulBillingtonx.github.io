<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such occurrences. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not think that these concerns modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
