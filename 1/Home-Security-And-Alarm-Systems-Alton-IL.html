<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were outstanding in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.

<p>During our testing, this compact camera taped sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We particularly like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of vision, because you're less most likely to get a blind spot any place you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>The SimpliSafe equipment is now in its third version, with a simpler and more elegant style for both app and devices. The base station is curvier and the sensors are smaller sized, but the range is much better, appealing connections to wireless sensors up to 800 feet away.
