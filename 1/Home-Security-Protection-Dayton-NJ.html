<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
