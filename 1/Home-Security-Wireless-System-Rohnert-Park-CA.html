Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls however will still require cables to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
