<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a top priority, make sure your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those individuals and will send smart device alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
