<p>Having pets suggests you will need to consider their size, motions, and any other aspects that might trigger problems. For example, if you have family pets that are over 30 pounds, you will require a security system whose motion sensing units can be changed or a system that can be set up in such a method that your large pets will not cause false alarms to be sent every time your pet moves.

<p>Alder does not market prices for its security systems online, and because each client's individual system may differ, the price might differ as well.

<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Of course, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for example, are compatible with the IP cameras just from specific producers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you must initially make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you've bought. The cameras should be able to offer you with the needed details if you're working with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system.</p>
