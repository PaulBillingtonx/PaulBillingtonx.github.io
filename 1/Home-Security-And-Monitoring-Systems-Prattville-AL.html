<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home.

We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
