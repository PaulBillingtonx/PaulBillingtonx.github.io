<p>Firstly, it's hard to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>For these different systems to assemble or to incorporate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files offering functionality and setup information to make this combination work, there are only 2 choices. The very first option, which might be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or reluctant to offer those details) and document the topology and how they can be integrated into the new DVS system. The other method is to change and rip, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
