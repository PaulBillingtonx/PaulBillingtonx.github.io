<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion.
