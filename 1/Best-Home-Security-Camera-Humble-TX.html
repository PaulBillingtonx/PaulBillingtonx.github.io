<p>Another location where Arlo excels is customer service.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
