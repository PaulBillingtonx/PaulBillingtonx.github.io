The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of night, use and day images have constantly been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we experienced when checking the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion detected.
