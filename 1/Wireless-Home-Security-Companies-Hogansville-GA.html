<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>Fixed-mount security cameras are non-discriminating in what they tape; whatever within their focus ability is captured.

But you can't buy this camera by itself-- you need to add to a complete Vivint home security system. </p>
