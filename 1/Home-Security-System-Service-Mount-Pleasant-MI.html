<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are various because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
