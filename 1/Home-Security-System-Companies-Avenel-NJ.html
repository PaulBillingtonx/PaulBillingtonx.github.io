<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of finding tiny differences in temperature. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature distinctions.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level.
