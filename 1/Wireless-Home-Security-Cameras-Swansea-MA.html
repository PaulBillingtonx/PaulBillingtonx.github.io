<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
