<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential. In reality, we don't recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an individual and a cars and truck, for example, allows you to cut down on unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
