<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network must be within 300 feet for ideal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal.

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it ought to be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
<p>When it comes to the wired systems, you can have it monitored or unmonitored. You can even do some of the monitoring yourself in certain instances.
