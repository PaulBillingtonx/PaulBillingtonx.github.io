<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers realize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
