<p>We deliver value-added security and surveillance systems and services using benefit, comfort and complete satisfaction to every consumer and are dedicated to fulfilling our consumer's needs with integrity, honesty, enthusiasm and exceptional service. Almost all of the current DIY and high-end home security systems use support for voice control by means of Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and in some cases Apple Siri, which enables you to open doors, change thermostat settings, open the garage, and arm or deactivate your system with a spoken command to a connected gadget like an Amazon Echo or a Google Home speaker.

<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the restricted range of sensing units. Many radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

When possible, we evaluated each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint offers a variety of equipment and home automation items at a reasonable rate, the one area where the company particularly stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
