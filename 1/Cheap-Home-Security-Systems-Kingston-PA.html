Occupants love Brinks wireless security systems now with a range of home automation functions. Wish to keep an eye on your home? Our Home Automation plan presents video to your home security service.

<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment pricing is very reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
