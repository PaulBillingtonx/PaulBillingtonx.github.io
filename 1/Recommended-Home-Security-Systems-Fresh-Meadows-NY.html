<p>Years earlier, all alarm systems needed you to have a landline phone and that landline was used to connect your security system to the monitoring center and there weren't any other options. However, today, lots of people don't even have a landline phone since they utilize their smart phones for everything. Therefore, a wireless security system is now the most apparent choice for many individuals, particularly those who do not have a landline and do not want to rely entirely on their web connection.</p>

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
