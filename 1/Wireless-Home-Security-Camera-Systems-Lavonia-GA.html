<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
