<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be poisonous to both human beings and animals. Since carbon monoxide gas is odor-free and colorless, the only method to monitor harmful levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide detector. Thankfully, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your home increases to an unsafe level. With a wireless system, you can also get push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not in your home.</p>
<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
