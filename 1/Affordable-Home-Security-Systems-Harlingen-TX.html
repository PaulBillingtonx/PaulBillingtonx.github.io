ADT gives you lots of alternatives. You can lease a system from them or buy monitoring for an existing system. They can monitor equipment made by many of the leading brand names. They support a full spectrum of wireless security functions, consisting of video monitoring, home automation, sensing units to avoid an environmental disaster, and medical alerts.

You can wear the pendant as a locket or bracelet, or you can clip it to your clothes.

Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
