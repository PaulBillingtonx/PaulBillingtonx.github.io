<p>Expenses for systems vary. Larger systems that offer full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical choice. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty standard feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>I explained that all we would require to do is take advantage of any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would end up being the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>

Look for an outdoor camera that will integrate with other wise home gadgets such as garage door openers, external sirens, and clever switches.</p>
<p>The answer depends upon the type of system included. The systems are best defined by the kinds of cameras used. There are two typical kinds of cameras in use today: Analog and IP-based cameras.
