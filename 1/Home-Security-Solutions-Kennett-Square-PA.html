<p>After reading the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they provided; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter bundle I believe starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so altogether a great deal. At home assessments are sales opportunities for security companies.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency since it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
