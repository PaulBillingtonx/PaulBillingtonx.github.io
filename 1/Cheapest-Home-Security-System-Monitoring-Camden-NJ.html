<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
<p>We suggest Brinks since they provide the highest level of home security and fire protection among the other companies available in Seattle, WA.
