But neither can tape constantly, and they both need the Ring Secure plan to capture recordings. Likewise, the wired variation normally left gaps of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras utilize to minimize incorrect informs.</p>
