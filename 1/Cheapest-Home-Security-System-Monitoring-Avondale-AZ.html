<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize also (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though.

<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the needed systems is essential. There are just 2 options if there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup details to make this integration work.
