<p>Motion Detection: If you're worried about video storage, check to see if the camera provides motion detection. The camera will only tape-record when it senses movement, saving you storage space and time searching unnecessary footage.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Activity notices inform the user whenever substantial activity is found near the camera. Find out if you can get alerts by means of push notices, text, and or e-mail. They'll keep you abreast of anything happening real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, especially for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the first place. What you're paying for is primarily that huge name in blue. </p>
