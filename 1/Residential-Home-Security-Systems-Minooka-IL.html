<p>The price of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio.

That individual at Deep Guard's center can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best Do It Yourself outdoor security camera we've seen to date.</p>
