At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas many other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away intruders in many cases.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad.
