A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated separately and don't recommend for the majority of people.</p>

<p>Another location where Arlo stands out is customer care. After long-lasting testing this camera given that we initially made it a pick in 2016, we saw that our Arlo Q started predicting a pink tint, which seems to be a continuous issue for some owners.
