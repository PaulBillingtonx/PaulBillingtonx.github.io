<h3>Best Burglar Alarm in Lindon UT</h3>

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur frequently enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be changed or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is typically balanced out by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>While the majority of providers offer you the option to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security package, SimpliSafe's choice is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera consists of functions like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic functions found on the majority of surveillance cameras. </p>
