Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
